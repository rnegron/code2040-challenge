# Info

This repository houses the solutions to [CODE2040](http://code2040.org/)'s coding challenges for prospective Fellows.

standard, which was interesting. All in all, I had a good time with these
challenges!

For stage4.py, I used the following:
["Easy way to add n seconds to a datetime time")](http://stackoverflow.com/a/100345)
